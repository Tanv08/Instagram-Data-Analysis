# Instagram-Data-Analysis
### I imported the unprocessed Instagram data from Kaggle into a Jupyter notebook using the Pandas library.
### Applied EDA to it using a variety of parameters, including the audience country.
### Created a pivot table based on the Instagram accounts' categories, and then conducted statistical analysis on the number of followers and engagement for each category.

### The top followers in each category and the average engagement in each category are plotted in pivot tables.
### Plotted visualizations for the top 10 and 20 followers in the fashion category, which has the most followers.

### According to the data, the most popular Instagram category and the one with the most followers in the United States is fashion.
